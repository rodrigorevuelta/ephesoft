Ephesoft mailroom automation brings easy to use and easy to configure solutions to anyone receives hard copy documents, emails and faxes. The solution also distributes the documents to their destinations such as line of business within an organization or a specific individual or department.

Ephesoft automates the document ingestion process by automatically sorting, classifying and extracting important data from these documents. The following steps demonstrates how Ephesoft solution automates the process.

Document Tracking:
Ephesoft tracks documents as soon as they arrive, unlike the other vendors, not after the document is scanned. Consider a document service center where a set of documents are received in the form of a banker box, FedEx/UPS/USPS or the inter office envelope. Ephesoft allows you to initiate document tracking right at the beginning of the process.

◦Automatic matching of work-flows for physical and scanned documents
◦Integration with third party application using Web Services API.
Document Ingestion (Scanning / Importing / Linking):
Ephesoft not only scans your documents using hi-speed scanners but also ingests documents using mailroom level scanners such as IBML, Opex or NCR. Ephesoft recognizes that not all the documents are scanned. Organizations may receive documents via fax, e-mail or EDI. Ephesoft is designed to integrate all of these sources.

Ephesoft solves yet another challenge with already scanned and archived documents in repositories such as FileNet, Documentum, Sharepoint or Alfresco. Ephesoft can initiate document capture process right from these sources and process the document while keeping the document in its repository.

Benefits:

◦Scan or import documents virtually from any sources such as fax and e-mail with one application.
◦Process documents that are stored in the repositories.
◦Utilize any existing hardware whether it is a Fujitsu scanner or IBML

◦Utilize any existing hardware whether it is a document scanner from Fujitsu, Kodak, etc or mailroom scanners such as IBML or Opex
Automatic Sorting (Classification and Separation):
One of the biggest benefits that Ephesoft brings is the ability to classify and sort documents. Users can train the documents by giving samples and the system will "Learn" them by utilizing several technologies such as OCR or Layout Classification. The system can learn documents based on its content read much like a human does. It learns the unique words for each document and considers titles or other features such as bar-codes.

Benefits:

◦Learns hundreds of documents within minutes and sorts the documents more efficiently.
◦Can separate documents by identifying where a document starts and ends.
◦Allows operators to focus on only the exceptions.
Details:

◦Uses Lucene Project to support the Content Classification engine.
◦Uses ImageMagick Project for the Layout Classification engine.

Automatic Data Extraction:
Ephesoft is designed to capture appurtenant data from the documents to aid sorting of the documents and also reduce labor costs assiciated with data-entry. Ephesoft can extract information such as Dates, Load numbers, Policy numbers, Claim Numbers, Invoice Numbers, Bar-coded values and even a table, line item, data. Data extraction is one of the key elements of Ephesoft in streamlining the document handling process.

◦Supports common data formats like Barcodes, Dates, Line Items and Regular Expressions.
◦Reduces overall document ingestion time and exceeds SLAs.
Delivery System:
Once the documents are sorted, classified and extracted automatically, they need to be delivered to their destination. In its simple form, destination is where the document is needed. this could be a line of business, a specific user, a branch office or a back end system. Ephesoft is designed to work with several back-end systems such as ECM, BPM or notification servers like email or Fax servers.
